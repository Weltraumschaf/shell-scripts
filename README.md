# Shell-Scripts

Collection of shell scripts I need on my computers.

You can use them if you think they are useful.
All stuff is under the [Beer-Ware-License](http://www.weltraumschaf.de/the-beer-ware-license.txt).

## Installation

Clone the repo and run the install script:

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/Weltraumschaf/shell-scripts.git
cd shell-scripts
./install.sh
```

This will create the `bin` direcotry in your home direcotry, if it does not
exist yet. And then links all scripts from `src` to that dir.
